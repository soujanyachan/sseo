      1. The Flesch Reading Ease formula 
         1. https://stackoverflow.com/a/5615724 
         2. steps
            1. RE = 206.835 – (1.015 x ASL) – (84.6 x ASW)
            2. RE = Readability Ease 
            3. ASL = Average Sentence Length (i.e., the number of words divided by the number of sentences)
            4. ASW = Average number of syllables per word (i.e., the number of syllables divided by the number of words)
         3. 90-100 : Very Easy
            80-89 : Easy
            70-79 : Fairly Easy
            60-69 : Standard
            50-59 : Fairly Difficult
            30-49 : Difficult
            0-29 : Very Confusing
         4. Flesch Reading Ease Formula has certain ambiguities. For instance, periods, explanation points, colons and semicolons serve as sentence delimiters; each group of continuous non-blank characters with beginning and ending punctuation removed counts as a word; each vowel in a word is considered one syllable subject to: (a) -es, -ed and -e (except -le) endings are ignored; (b) words of three letters or shorter count as single syllables; and (c) consecutive vowels count as one syllable.
